# Integer Linked List

It demonstrates how linked list will work in action. This is an example from Deitel book (C how to program) but the problem is that the linked list source code in the book won't compile and it has memory leak issue (added a deleteAll function to avoid memory leak ).
So I improved it a little bit. I struggled a lot when I started programming becasue this was my first book and it really confused me with pointers. I hope the code that I provided could
help others understand pointers and especially linked list better. In my opinion the best book to learn C (especially pointers subject) is Programming in C by Stephen G. Kochan.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

For Linux:<br />
    * GCC <br />
    * Your choice of IDE<br />
    
For Windows:<br />
    1. Use visual studio (You don't need to install a compiler it has its own)<br />
        * [Visual Studio Installation Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio)<br />
    2. Use Code::Blocks editor and MinGW as compiler( I take no responsiblity towards the links that I provided if you don't trust them use Visual Studio):<br />
        * [Code::Blocks Download](http://codeblocks.org/downloads/26) <br />
        * [MinGW Download Link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/)<br />
        * [MinGW Installation Guide for Code::Blocks](http://wiki.codeblocks.org/index.php/MinGW_installation)<br />


### Compilation
For Linux:<br />
    1. Go to the int_Linkedlist directory<br />
    2. Open your terminal<br />
    3. Run GCC<br />
      ```
      gcc linkedlist.c -o linkedlist
      ```<br />
    4. Now run the program<br />
      ```
      ./linkedlist
      ```<br />

For Windows ( It applies for Code::Blocks too):<br />
    1. Open Visual Studio<br />
    2. Open linkedlist.c file<br />
    3. Complie and run it<br />
